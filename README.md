# HPSim

HPSim is a GPU-accelerated online multi-particle beam dynamics simulation tool 
for ion linacs. It was originally developed for use on the Los Alamos 800-MeV 
proton linac with the goal of providing a fast and accurate tool for realistic 
beam simulations of the actual operating linac. It runs on a GPU equipped 
workstation. The simulation parameters mirror those of the actual accelerator 
and can be manipulated through Python scripts in an offline mode or track them 
when connected via EPICS in an online mode.

It is a “z-code” that contains typical linac beam transport elements. The linac 
RF-gap transformation utilizes transit-time-factors to calculate the beam 
acceleration therein. The space-charge effects are computed using the 2D SCHEFF 
(Space CHarge EFFect) algorithm, which calculates the radial and longitudinal 
space charge forces for cylindrically symmetric beam distributions. Other 
space-charge routines to be incorporated include the 3D PICNIC and a 3D Poisson 
solver. HPSim can simulate beam dynamics in drift tube linacs (DTLs) and 
coupled cavity linacs (CCLs). Elliptical superconducting cavity (SC) structures 
will also be incorporated into the code.
 
The computational core of the code is written in C++ and accelerated using the 
NVIDIA CUDA technology. Users access the core code, which is wrapped in 
Python/C APIs, via Pythons scripts that enable ease-of-use and automation of 
the simulations. The overall linac description including the EPICS Process 
Variable machine control parameters is kept in an SQLite database that also 
contains calibration and conversion factors required to transform the machine 
set points into model values used in the simulation.

# Build & Run on Darwin (Power 8 + Tesla P100)
  `module load cuda`
  
  `git checkout noepics`
  
  `cd src`
  
  `make`

Now../bin/HPSim.so should be generated and we can run a test 

  `cd ../pytest`
  
  `python sim-lbeg.py`
